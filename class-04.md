# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## HTML book:

### Chapter 4: “Links” (pp.74-93):

* Links are made by using the anchor element '< a >' and specify the target directory with href attribute.

* If you want to link to another site, you need to use full web address which is known as **absolute URL**, but if you want to link to another page of the same website you dont need the domain name in the URL, you can instead use **Relative URL**

* You can add Email links by using < a > element then attribute href="mailto:email@adress.com"

* You can open a new window when you click a link by adding the attribute **target="_blank"**

* You can link to a specific part of a page by utilizing id on that part of the site, and then linking it with < a > href="#theID" .

### Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404):


* CSS treets each HTML element as if it's in it's own box, either an inline or a block level box.

* If a block element is nested inside another block element, then the outer box is the containing or the parent element.

* You can change the layout of the page using the position property in CSS; ex: normal flow, relative positioning and absolute positioning, also to indicate where the box should be positioned we can use box offset properties.



## JS book:

### Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY):

* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task, functions statements do not run until the function is called like this **functionName();** .

* Before you can call a function, first you need to declare it by using the function keyword, then the function name and the code block in curly brackets, the value inside the parameters are called **arguments**

* You can declare a function's information with parameters between paranthesis (width, height), you can call functions that need this type of information by using arguments as values getArea(3 , 5); or arguments as variables width= 3; , height=5 , getArea(width, height); .

* We can retrieve a value from a function using return keyword, if it's used, then the function is left.

* If you want more than one value from the function, you must create an array, save the values you want into variables that go into the array, then return the array.

* If a function is saved into a variable, it's called function expression, ex: area = function(x,y) etc, if its not saved into a variable it's called anonymous function.

* If you declare a variable within a function, it will be useable only inside that function, this is known as **variables scope**, it's called local variable.

* Variables reference a value that is stored, the same value can be used with more than one variable.

## Pair Programming

* Pair programming has two main roles, the driver and the navigator, the driver is the programmer who types, while the navigator guides the driver and thinks about the big picture.

* Pair programming help you with efficiency, as two people working on the same problem can come with solutions faster than one person.

* It also helps with focusing, when two programmers work together they focus better.

* Learn from fellow students and colleagues, as you can see new problem solving methods and add them to your own.

* It improves your social skills since you work with another person who might have a different coding style.

* Job, interview and work environment readiness.
