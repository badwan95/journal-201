# JS Debugging

## From the Duckett JS book

### Error Handling & Debugging - P.449 - P.486

* In JavaScript,the interpeter uses the concept of execution contexts, like function contexts gets executed without being the first in order.

* JS Interpeter processes one line of code at a time,when something requires data from another function it stacks (piles) the new function on top of the current task

* Scope is like a container for variables if the variable isnt a global variable.

* When a statement gives an error then it throws an exception and the interpeter stops and looks for exception handling code.

* Error objects are created to help you find the mistakes in your code.

* Types of errors: 1-Syntax error 2- mismatching or unclosed quotes 3-missing closing bracket, etc...

* Deal with errors: debug the script, or by using try,catch,throw and finally statements, like when you request data from third party site and their server doesn't respond.

* Different browsers have different styles of consoles.

* You can try your code in the browser's console directly.

* Always log data to console to find what happenss
