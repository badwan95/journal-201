# HTML

## Introduction and structure of HTML

People use computers,phones, tablets etc.. to access the web on using a web browser.

Websites are sent over the web as HTML, CSS and Javascript, and the browser itself interprets the code to create the webpage we see.

Using of headings and subheadings in any documentary reflects the hierarchy of information.

- **HTML Describes the structure of the page**, it is defined by elements that are made up of two tags; an opening tag and a closing tag, and attributes tell us more about a tag.

- Most of the attributes can be used on certain elements, althought some can appear on any element (like the lang attribute).

> < head> element contains information about the page, < body> element everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser.


## Looking at how other sites are built
You can always check the source code of a website (check the HTML file) by clicking "view source" 

# Chapter 9: Extra Markup

* Use **DOCTYPE** to tell the browser which version of HTML is running.

* To add a comment,use <!-- -->, its a good idea to add comments to your code.

* The **ID** and **class** Attributes, its used to identify that element uniquely, it helps a lot with CSS and Javascript, its known as 

* Block Elements: they will always start a new line in the browser window, ex: < h1>, < p>, < ul>, and < li>, while Inline Elements continue on the same line as their counterpart element, ex: < a>, < b>, < em>, and < img>.

### Grouping text and elements in a block
*  div element: it allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box

* The < span> element is like an inline equivalent of the div element, its mostly used with class or id attribute to style a specific portion with CSS.

* The IFRAME element < iframe> is a like a little window into another website

### Meta element lives inside the head element and it contains data about the webpage, its not visible to users.

Meta element is an empty element so it doesnt have a closing tag, it uses attributes to carry information, for example they can be used by name="something" or http-equiv="something"


### Escape Characters can be used to include special characters that are reserved by the HTML code like the left and right anagled brackets.

* So if you want to type one of those special characters you must use one of the escape codes, like &lt that is left angled bracket.

## HTML5 Layout

HTML5 introduced new elements that allows you to divide up parts of the page, and they are named to indicate their purpose, elements examples:

> < nav>;it contains major navigational blocks on the site, < article>,It's a container to put text in, like a paragraph, < div>,< footer>, usually contains info like copyright and trademarks

* We can help older browsers understand HTML5 by using a simple Javascript

# Chapter 18: Process and Design

* A website should be designed with one question in mind, who is it for? if its for an individual, then you should ask aaquestions about your target audience like their age, income etc...

* Site maps lets you plan website structure

* Wireframe is a sketch that organizes where information on each page goes.

* Differentiate between information using size, color and style, also you can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

# JavaScript: Introduction & Ch1: ABC of Programming

* You need to know the vocabulary and structure of sentences in JS just like any new language you learn.

* jQuery helps with inconsistencies among different browsers.

* Scripts are set of instructions that your computer follows step by step.

* In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an **object** (like the car and hotels in the book example), each object can have its own properties, events and methods.

* Properties : like the color of the car and engine etc...

* Each property has a name and a value.

* Events: is the computer's way of sticking up its hand to say, "Hey, this just happened!", its a part of the script to activate a specific portion of the script itself.

* Methods: its like a set of instructions that are already defined, you just need to give it variables.

* Javascript doesnt change the source code of HTML, it just shows a link to the HTML file.
