#  Forms and Events

## From the Duckett HTML book:

### Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)

* forms are a way for someone to enter data into a webpage, whether that is searching or registering or loging in etc..

* form elements start with < form > and you need toadd action element for it to save the data to somewhere, so you put the url of the page inside of it

* inside form, you can add a a label then an input (with attribute like type='text' or 'password' etc) or a button element aswell.

* there are many types of form ways, including text input,password,radio, checkbox etc...

* In HTML5 you can use form validation without going to javascript, also date input, email and url, search etc...

### Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)

 * you can change the list styling using list-style-type or image, and change the position of the marker either inside or outside

* you can edit the styles of css and hide empty rows using empty-cells: hide;

* you can change what the cursor looks like when you hover by the cursor property.

## From the Duckett JS book:

### Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)

* events are a browser way of saying something happened, and our script can respond to this event.

* different events are triggered by different inputs, like mouse events, keyboard events etc etc...

* when an event occurs, its refered to as fired or raised, so it triggers a function or a script like input events submit etc etc...

* Event handler controls every interaction between the event and the triggering of javascript code, at first you select element, then you specify the event it triggers, then call the code.

* ways to bind an event to an element by DOM event handlers or event listeners.

* syntax of traditional dom event handlers : element.theEventName = functionName;

* for event listeners: element.addeventlistener( parameters);

* flow matters only if you have event handlers on an element or its ancestor/descendant elements

* Event object: it tells information about the event and the element it occured on
